  <title>Using Threads to Improve
  Interface Responsiveness</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
       One good use for a <em>multithreaded</em>
      program is to help make a more responsive user interface.
      In a single-threaded program,
      a program that is executing statements in a long
      (perhaps even infinite)
      loop remains unresponsive to the user's actions until the loop is exited.
      Thus, the user will experience a noticeable and sometimes frustrating delay 
      between the time an action is initiated and the time it is actually handled by the program.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="fig-dotsscreen">
    <title>Single-Threaded Design</title>
    <p>
      It's always a good idea that the interface be responsive to user input,
      but sometimes it is crucial to an application.
      For example,
      suppose a psychology experiment is trying to measure how quickly a user responds to 
      a certain stimulus presented by a program.
      Obviously, for this kind of application,
      the program should take action as soon as the user clicks a button to indicate a response to the stimulus.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Let's work through an appropriate program design for the experiment.
      First, we will formally state the situation and describe what the program should do.
      Then, we will examine the components that would make up an effective program.

    <title>Problem Statement</title>
    <p>
      A psychologist is conducting a psychometric experiment to measure user 
      response to a visual cue and asks you to create the following program.
      The program should have two buttons.
      When the Draw button is clicked,
      the program begins drawing black dots at  random locations within a 
      rectangular region of the screen (<xref ref="fig-dotsprog">Figure</xref>).
      After a random time interval,
      the program begins drawing red dots.
      This change corresponds to the presentation of the stimulus.
      As soon as the stimulus is presented the user is supposed to click on a Clear button,
      which clears the drawing area.
      To provide a measure of the user's reaction time,
      the program should report how many red dots were drawn before the user clicked the Clear button.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-dotsgui">Figure</xref> 
      shows a design for this program's GUI. 
      It contains a control <c>JPanel</c> that contains the two
      <c>JButton</c>s.
      The dots are drawn on a <c>JPanel</c>, which is positioned 
      in the center of a <c>BorderLayout</c> design.

    <title>Problem Decomposition</title>
    <p>
      This program should be decomposed into two classes,
      a GUI to handle  the user interface and a drawing class to manage the drawing.
      The main features of its classes are as follows:
      <ul>
      <li><p>
        RandomDotGUI Class: This class manages the user 
        interface, responding to user actions by calling methods of 
        the <c>Dotty</c> class (<xref ref="Fig-randomdotGUI">Figure</xref>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p> 
        Dotty Class: This class contains <c>draw()</c> and <c>clear()</c> 
        methods for drawing on the GUI's drawing panel  (<xref ref="fig-dottyclass">Figure</xref>).

      The GUI arranges the control and drawing panels in a <c>BorderLayout</c> and 
      listens for action events on its <c>JButton</c>s.
      When the user clicks the Draw button,
      the GUI's <c>actionPerformed()</c> method will create a new

      Note that <c>Dotty</c> is passed a reference to the drawing

      When the user clicks the Clear button,
      the GUI should call the <c>dotty.clear()</c> method.

  <subsection xml:id="self-study-exerciseP34">
    <title>The <c>Dotty</c>Class</title>
    <p>
      The purpose of the <c>Dotty</c> class will be to draw the dots and to report 
      how many red dots were drawn before the canvas was cleared.
      Because it will be passed a reference to the drawing panel and the number of dots to draw,
      the <c>Dotty</c> class will need instance variables to store these two values.
      It will also need a variable to keep track of how many dots were drawn.
      Finally, since it will be drawing within a fixed rectangle on the panel,
      the reference coordinates and dimensions of the drawing area are declared as class constants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>Dotty()</c> constructor method will be passed a reference to a drawing 
      panel as well as the number of dots to be drawn and will merely assign these
      parameters to its instance variables.
      In addition to its constructor method,
      the <c>Dotty</c> class will have public
      <c>draw()</c> and <c>clear()</c> methods,
      which will be called from the GUI. The <c>draw()</c> method will use a loop to draw random dots.
      The <c>clear()</c> will clear the canvas and report the number of dots drawn.

 </input></program>
    </listing>
    <p>
      The complete implementation of <c>Dotty</c> is shown in <xref ref="fig-singledotty">Listing</xref>.
      Note how its <c>draw()</c> method is designed.
      The drawing loop is bounded by the number of iterations. To slow down the drawing,
      it will iterate 1 billion times, drawing a dot on each millionth iteration.
      For each dot,
      the <c>draw()</c> method picks a random location within the rectangle defined 
      by the coordinates (HREF,VREF) and (HREF+LEN, VREF+LEN), and draws a dot there.
      Each time it draws a dot it computes a random number, which if less than 0.05,
      the drawing color is changed to red and a record is made of the number of dots drawn up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem with this design is that as long as the <c>draw()</c> method is executing,
      the program will be unable to respond to the GUI's Clear button.
      In a single-threaded design,
      both the GUI and <c>dotty</c> are combined into a single thread of execution (Fig.
      <xref ref="fig-dottytrace"></xref>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-dottytrace">
      <caption>A single-threaded execution of random
      dot drawing.</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="chptr14/13f6.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      When the user clicks the Draw button,
      the GUI's <c>actionPerformed()</c> method is invoked.
      It then invokes <c>Dotty</c>'s
      <c>draw()</c> method,
      which must run to completion before anything else can be done.
      If the user clicks the Clear button while the dots are being drawn,
      the GUI won't be able to get to this until all the dots are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you will see when you run the program,
      the drawing panel will not clear until all 1000 dots are drawn,
      no matter when the Clear button is pressed.
      Therefore, the values reported for the user's reaction time will be wrong.
      Obviously, since it is so unresponsive to user input,
      this design completely fails to satisfy the program's specifications.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Single-Threaded Loop</title>
      <p>
        In a single-threaded design,
        a loop that requires lots of iterations will completely dominate the CPU during its execution,
        which forces other tasks, including user I/O tasks, to wait.

    <title>Multithreaded Drawing: The <c>Dotty</c>Thread</title>
    <p>
      One way to remedy this problem is to create a second thread
      (in addition to the GUI itself)
      to do the drawing.
      The drawing thread will be responsible just for drawing,
      while the GUI thread will be responsible for handling user actions in the interface.
      The trick to making the user interface more responsive will 
      be to interrupt the drawing thread periodically so that the GUI 
      thread has a chance to  handle any events that have occurred.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-dottythread">
      <image width="30%" source="chptr14/p719f1.png"/>
      <caption></caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      As <xref ref="fig-dottythread">Figure</xref> illustrates,
      the easiest way to convert
      <c>Dotty</c> into a thread is to have it implement the <c>Runnable</c> interface:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public class Dotty implements Runnable {
    // Everything else remains the same
    public void run() {
        draw();
    }
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      This version of <c>Dotty</c> will perform the same task as before except 
      that it will now run as a separate thread of execution.
      Note that its <c>run()</c> method just calls the <c>draw()</c> method 
      that we defined in the previous version.
      When the <c>Dotty</c> thread is started by the <c>RandomDotGUI</c>, 
      we will have a multithreaded program.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, just because this program has two threads doesn't necessarily 
      mean that it will be any more responsive to the user.
      There's no guarantee that the drawing thread will stop as soon 
      as the Clear button is clicked.
      On most systems,
      if both threads have  equal priority,
      the GUI thread won't run until the drawing thread finishes drawing all <em>N</em> dots.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Thread Control</title>
      <p>
        Just breaking a program into two separate threads won't necessarily give you the desired performance.
        It might be necessary to <term>coordinate</term> the threads.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Therefore, we have to modify our design in order to guarantee that 
      the GUI thread will get a chance to handle the user's actions.
      One good way to do this is to have <c>Dotty</c> sleep for a short 
      instance after it draws each dot.
      When a thread sleeps,
      any other  threads that are waiting their turn will get a chance to run.
      If the GUI thread is waiting to handle the user's click on Clear,
      it will now be able to call <c>Dotty</c>'s <c>clear()</c> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new version of <c>draw()</c> is shown in <xref ref="fig-threadeddotty">Figure</xref>.
      In this version of <c>draw()</c>, the thread sleeps for 1 millisecond on each iteration of the loop.
      This will make it possible for the GUI to run on every iteration,
      so it will handle user actions immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another necessary change is that once the <c>clear()</c> method is called,
      the <c>Dotty</c> thread should stop running
      (drawing).
      The correct way to stop a thread is to use some variable whose value will cause the run loop
      (or in this case the drawing loop)
      to exit, so the new version of <c>Dotty</c> uses the <c>boolean</c> variable
      <c>isCleared</c> to control when drawing is stopped.
      Note that the variable is initialized to <c>false</c> and then set to <c>true</c> in the
      <c>clear()</c> method.
      The while loop in <c>draw()</c> will exit when
      <c>isCleared</c> becomes <c>true</c>. This causes the <c>draw()</c> method to return,
      which causes the <c>run()</c> method to return,
      which causes the thread to stop in an orderly fashion.

      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Threaded GUIs</title>
      <p>
        Designing a multithreaded GUI involves creating a secondary 
        thread that will run concurrently with the main GUI thread.
        The GUI thread handles the user interface,
        while the secondary thread performs CPU-intensive calculations.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Threading a GUI</title>
      <p>
        Creating a second thread within a GUI requires three steps: 
        (1) Define the secondary thread to implement the <c>Runnable</c> interface, 
        (2) override its <c>run()</c> method,
        and (3) incorporate some mechanism,
        such as a <c>sleep()</c> state,
        into the thread's run algorithm so that the GUI thread will have a chance to run periodically.

    <title>Modifications to <c>RandomDotGUI</c></title>
    <p>
      We don't need to make many changes in <c>RandomDotGUI</c> to get it to work 
      with the new version of <c>Dotty</c>. The primary change comes in the <c>actionPerformed()</c> method.
      Each time the Draw button was clicked in the original version of this method,
      we created a <c>dotty</c> instance and then called its <c>draw()</c> method.
      In the revised version we must create a new <c>Thread</c> and pass it 
      an instance of <c>Dotty</c>, which will then run as a separate thread:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    if (e.getSource() == draw) {
        dotty = new Dotty(canvas, NDOTS);
        dottyThread = new Thread(dotty);
        dottyThread.start();
    } else {
        dotty.clear();
    } 
} // actionPerformed()
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Note that in addition to a reference to <c>dotty</c> we also 
      have a reference to a <c>Thread</c> named <c>dottyThread</c>. 
      This additional variable must be declared within the GUI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that when you call the <c>start()</c> method,
      it automatically calls the thread's <c>run()</c> method.
      When <c>dottyThread</c> starts to run,
      it will immediately call the <c>draw()</c> method and start drawing dots.
      After each dot is drawn, <c>dottyThread</c> will sleep for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how the GUI stops the drawing thread.
      In the new version, <c>Dotty.clear()</c> will set the <c>isCleared</c> variable,
      which will cause the drawing loop to terminate.
      Once again, this is the proper way to stop a thread.
      Thus, as soon as the user clicks the Clear button,
      the <c>Dotty</c> thread will stop drawing and report its result.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Stopping a Thread</title>
      <p>
        The best way to stop a thread is to use a <c>boolean</c> 
        control variable whose value can be set to true or false to exit the <c>run()</c> loop.
      </p>
    </principle>

    <title>Advantages of Multithreaded Design</title>
    <p>
      By creating a separate thread for <c>Dotty</c>, we have turned 
      a single-threaded program into a multithreaded program.
      One thread, the GUI, handles the user interface.
      The second thread handles the drawing task.
      By forcing the drawing to sleep on each iteration,
      we guarantee that the GUI thread will remain responsive to the user's actions.
      <xref ref="fig-threadedtrace">Figure</xref>
      illustrates the difference  between the single- and multithreaded designs.
      Note that the GUI thread starts and stops the drawing thread,
      and the GUI thread executes <c>dotty.clear()</c>. The drawing thread simply executes its
      <c>draw()</c> method.
      In the single-threaded version,
      all of these actions are done by one thread.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-threadedtrace">
      <caption>Two independent threads: one for drawing,
      the other for the GUI.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr14/13f8.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The trade-off involved in this design is that it will take longer to draw <em>N</em> random dots,
      since <c>dottyThread.draw()</c> will sleep for an instant on each iteration.
      However, the extra time is hardly noticeable.
      By breaking the program into two separate threads of control,
      one to handle the drawing task and one to handle the user interface,
      the result is a much more responsive program.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Responsive Interfaces</title>
      <p>
        In order to give a program a more responsive user interface,
        divide it into separate threads of control.
        Let one thread handle interactive tasks, such as user input,
        and let the second thread handle CPU-intensive computations.

            Instead of sleeping on each iteration,
            another way to make the interface more responsive would be to 
            set the threaded <c>Dotty</c>'s priority to a low number,
            such as <c>Thread.MIN_PRIORITY</c>.
            Make this change, and experiment with its effect on the program's responsiveness.
            Is it more or less responsive than sleeping on each iteration?

            True or false. round-robin scheduling would ensure the

<solution>
          <p>
            If round-robin scheduling is used,
            each thread will be get a portion of the CPU's time,
            so the I/O thread will eventually get its turn.
            But you don't know how long it will be before the GUI gets its turn,
            so there might still be an unacceptably long wait before the user's actions are handled.
