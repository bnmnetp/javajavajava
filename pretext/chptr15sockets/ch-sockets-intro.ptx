  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    One of the key strengths of Java is the support it provides for the Internet and client/server programming.
    In the previous chapter,
    we saw how to make Java programs transfer information to and from external files.
    Although files are external to the programs that process them,
    they are still located on the same computer.
    In this chapter,
    we learn how to transfer information to and from files that reside on a network.
    This enables programs to communicate with programs running on other computers.
    With networking,
    we can communicate with computers anywhere in the world.
