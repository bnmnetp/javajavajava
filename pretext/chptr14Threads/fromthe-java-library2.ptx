  <introduction>
  <p>
  The <c>java.lang.Thread</c> class contains the public methods shown
in <xref ref="fig-thread-intf">Figure</xref>
 (the figure contains only a partial list).  Note that
<c> Thread</c> implements the <c> Runnable</c> interface, which consists
simply of the <c>run</c> method.  As we will now see, another way to
create a thread is to instantiate a <c> Thread</c> object and pass it a
<c>Runnable</c> object that will become its body. This approach allows
you to turn an existing class into a separate thread.

    <p>
A <c>Runnable</c> object is any object that implements the <c>
Runnable</c> interface---that is, any object that implements the 
<c>run()</c> method (<xref ref="fig-runnable-intf">Figure</xref>). 
 The following example provides an
alternative way to implement the <c>NumberThread</c> program:
</p>

 <program language="java"><input>
public class NumberPrinter implements Runnable {
    int num;

    public void NumberPrinter(int n) {
        num = n;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int k=0; k &lt; 10; k++)
            System.out.print(num);
    } // run()
} // NumberPrinter
 </input></program>
 
<p> Given this definition, we would then pass instances of this class to
the individual threads as we create them:
</p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public class Numbers {
  public static void main(String args[]) {

    Thread number1, number2, number3, number4, number5;
     // Create and start each thread
    number1 = new Thread(new NumberPrinter(1)); number1.start(); 
    number2 = new Thread(new NumberPrinter(2)); number2.start();
    number3 = new Thread(new NumberPrinter(3)); number3.start();
    number4 = new Thread(new NumberPrinter(4)); number4.start();
    number5 = new Thread(new NumberPrinter(5)); number5.start();
  } // main()
} // Numbers
 </input></program>

<p> The <c> NumberPrinter</c> class implements
<c> Runnable</c> by defining exactly the same <c> run()</c> that was used
previously in the <c> NumberThread</c> class.  We then pass instances of
<c> NumberPrinter</c> when we create the individual threads.  Doing
things this way gives exactly the same output as earlier.  This example
serves to illustrate another way of creating a multithreaded program:
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Implement the <c> Runnable</c> interface for an existing class
 by implementing the <c> void run()</c> method, which contains the
 statements to be executed by that thread.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Create several <c> Thread</c> instances by first creating
 instances of the <c> Runnable</c> class and passing each instance as
 an argument to the <c>Thread()</c> constructor. 
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For each thread instance, start it by invoking the <c>start()</c> 
 method on it.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<principle>
<title>Thread Creation</title>
<p>
A thread can be created by
passing a <c> Runnable</c> object to a new <c>Thread</c> instance.  The
object's <c>run()</c> method will be invoked automatically as soon as
the thread's <c>start()</c> method is called.
</p>
</principle>
<principle>
<title>Converting a Class to a Thread</title>
<p>
Using the <c>Runnable</c> interface to create threads enables you to turn an existing
class into a thread.  For most applications, using the <c> Runnable</c>
interface is preferable to redefining the class as a <c> Thread</c>
subclass.
</p>
</principle>

<subsection><title>Self-Study Exercise</title>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
Use the <c>Runnable</c> interface to convert the
following class into a thread.  You want the
thread to print all the odd numbers up to its bound:
 <program language="java"><input>
public class PrintOdds {
    private int bound;
    public void PrintOdds(int b) {
        bound = b;
    }

    public void print() {
        if (int k = 1; k &lt; bound; k+=2)
            System.out.println(k);
    }
} // PrintOdds
</input></program>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
    <title>Thread Control</title>
    <p>
The various methods in the <c>Thread</c> class (Fig.~14.4)
can be used to exert some control over a thread's execution.  The <c>start()</c> and
<c>stop()</c> methods play the obvious roles of starting and stopping a
thread.  These methods will sometimes be called automatically.
For example, an applet is treated as a thread by the browser,
or appletviewer, which is responsible for starting and stopping it.
</p>
<p>
As we saw in the <c>NumberThread</c> example, the <c>run()</c> method
encapsulates the thread's basic algorithm.   It is usually not called
directly.  Instead, it is called by the thread's <c>start()</c> method,
which handles any system-dependent initialization tasks before calling
<c>run()</c>.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection>
    <title>Thread Priority</title>
<p>
The <c>setPriority(int)</c> method lets you set a thread's priority to
an integer value between <c>Thread.MIN\_PRIORITY</c> and
<c>Thread.MAX\_PRIOR\-ITY</c>, the bounds defined as constants in the
<c>Thread</c> class.  Using <c>set\-Prior\-ity()</c> gives you some control over a
thread's execution.  In general, higher-priority threads get to run
before, and longer than, lower-priority threads.
</p>  
<principle>
<title>Preemption</title>
<p> 
A higher-priority thread that
wants to run will {\it preempt} any threads of lower priority.
</p>
</principle>
<p>
To see how {\tt setPriority()} works, suppose we change
<c>NumberThread</c>'s constructor to the following:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
public NumberThread(int n) {
    num = n;
    setPriority(n);
}
</input></program> 
<p>
In this case, each thread sets its priority to its ID number.
So, thread five will have priority five, a higher priority than
all the other threads.   Suppose we now run 2 million iterations of
each of these threads.  Because 2 million iterations will take a long
time if we print the thread's ID on each iteration, let's modify the
<c>run()</c> method, so that the ID is printed every 1 million
iterations:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
for (int k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++)
    if (k % 1000000 == 0)
        System.out.print(num);
</input></program> 
<p>
Given this modification, we get the following output when we
run  <c>Numbers()</c>}:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
5544332211
</input></program> 
<p>
It appears from this output that the threads ran to completion
in priority order.  Thus, thread five completed 2 million iterations before
thread four started to run, and so on.  This shows that, on my system at
least, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) supports priority scheduling.
</p>
<principle>
<title>Platform Dependence.</title>
<p>
Thread implementation in Java is platform dependent.  Adequate testing is 
necessary to ensure that a program will perform correctly on a given platform.
</p>
</principle>
<principle>
<title>Thread Coordination.</title>
<p>
One way to coordinate the behavior of two threads is to give one thread 
higher priority than another.
</p>
</principle>
<principle>
<title>Starvation.</title>
<p>
A high-priority thread that never gives up the CPU can starve lower-priority 
threads by preventing them from accessing the CPU.
</p>
</principle>
</subsection>
<subsection>
    <title>Forcing Threads to Sleep</title>
    <p>The <c>Thread.sleep()</c> and <c>Thread.yield()</c> methods also
provide some control over a thread's behavior.  When executed by
a thread, the <c>yield()</c> method causes the thread to
yield the CPU, allowing the thread scheduler to choose another
thread.  The <c>sleep()</c> method causes the thread to yield
and not to be scheduled until a certain amount of real time
has passed.
    </p>
<principle>
<title>Sleep Versus Yield.</title>
<p>
Both the <c>yield()</c> and <c>sleep()</c> methods yield the CPU, but the <c>sleep()</c> method
keeps the thread from being rescheduled for a fixed amount of real
time.
</p>
</principle>
  <p>
The <c>sleep()</c> method can halt a running thread for a given number
of milliseconds, allowing other waiting threads to run.  The <c>sleep()</c>
 method throws an <c>InterruptedException</c>, which is a
checked exception.  This means that the <c>sleep()</c> call must be
embedded within a <c>try/catch</c> block or the method it's in must
throw an <c>InterruptedException</c>.  Try/catch blocks were covered in
Chapter 10.
</p>  
<program language="java"><input>
try {
    sleep(100);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
</input></program> 
<p>
   For example, consider the following version of the
<c>NumberPrinter.run()</c>:
</p>
  <program language="java"><input>
public void run() {
    for (int k=0; k &lt; 10; k++) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep((long)(Math.random() * 1000));
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.print(num);
    } // for
} // run()
</input></program> 
 <p>
 In this example, each thread is forced to sleep for a random
number of milliseconds between 0 and 1,000. When a thread sleeps, it
gives up the CPU, which allows one of the other waiting threads to
run.  As you would expect, the output we get from this example will
reflect the randomness in the amount of time that each thread sleeps:
 </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
14522314532143154232152423541243235415523113435451
</input></program> 
<p>
As we will see, the <c>sleep()</c> method provides a
rudimentary form of thread synchronization, in which one thread
yields control to another.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
What happens if you run five <c>NumberThread</c>s of equal priority
through 2 million iterations each? Run this experiment and note the
output.  Don't print after every iteration! What sort of scheduling
algorithm (round-robin, priority scheduling, or something else) was used
to schedule threads of equal priority on your system?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Try the following experiment and note the output.   Let each thread
sleep for 50 milliseconds (rather than a random number of
milliseconds). How does this affect the scheduling of the threads? To
make things easier to see, print each thread's ID after every 100,000
iterations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
The purpose of the Java garbage collector is to recapture
memory that was used by objects that are no longer being
used by your program.  Should its thread have higher or
lower priority than your program?
          </p>

    <title>The Asynchronous Nature of Threaded Programs</title>
    <p>
Threads are <term>asynchronous</term>. This means that the order of execution
and the timing of a set of threads are unpredictable, at
least from the programmer's point of view.  Threads are executed under
the control of the scheduling algorithm used by the operating system
and the Java Virtual Machine.  In general, unless threads are
explicitly synchronized, it is impossible for the programmer to
predict when and for how long an individual thread will
run.  In some systems, under some circumstances, a thread might run to
completion before any other thread can run.  In other systems, or
under different circumstances, a thread might run for a short time and
then be suspended while another thread runs. Of course, when a thread
is preempted by the system, its state is saved so that its execution
can be resumed without losing any information.    
</p> 
<p>
One implication of a thread's asynchronicity is that it is not
generally possible to determine where in its source code an individual
thread might be preempted.  You can't even assume that a thread will
be able to complete a simple Java arithmetic operation once it has started
it.   For example, suppose a thread had to execute the following
operation:
</p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int N = 5 + 3;
</input></program> 
<p>
This operation computes the sum of 5 and 3 and assigns the result to
<c>N</c>.  It would be tempting to think that once the thread started
this operation, it would be able to complete it, but that is not
necessarily so.  You have to remember that Java code is compiled into
a rudimentary bytecode, which is translated still further into
the computer's machine language.   In machine language, this operation
would break down into something like the following three steps:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
Fetch 5 from memory and store it in register A.
Add 3 to register A.
Assign the value in register A to N.
</input></program>
<p>
Although none of the individual machine instructions can
be preempted, the thread could be interrupted between any two machine
instructions.  The point here is that not even a single Java language
instruction can be assumed to be indivisible or unpreemptible.
Therefore, it is impossible to make any assumptions about when a
particular thread will run and when it will give up the CPU. This
suggests the following important principle of multithreaded programs:
</p>
<principle>
      <title>Asynchronous Thread Principle</title>
<p>
Unless they are explicitly prioritized or synchronized, threads behave in a completely
<em>asynchronous</em> fashion.
</p>
</principle>
<principle>
      <title>Thread Timing.</title>
<p>
Unless they are explicitly synchronized, you cannot make any assumptions about when, or
in what order, individual threads will execute, or where a thread might be interrupted 
or preempted during its execution.
</p>
</principle>
<p>
As we will see, this principle plays a large role in the design of multithreaded programs.
