                The process of arranging an array's elements into a particular order is known as <c>__________</c> .

            <li>

            <li>
              <p>
                An <c>__________</c> is an object that can store a collection of elements of the same type.

            <li>
              <p>
                An <c>__________</c> is like an array except that it can grow.

            <li>
              <p>
                For an array,

            <li>
              <p>

          What's wrong with the following code segment,
          which is supposed to swap the values of the <c>int</c> variables,
          <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em>?

int temp = n1;
n2 = n1;

          Explain why the following method does not successfully swap the values of its two parameters?
          Hint: Think about the difference between value and reference parameters.
 <program language="java"><input>
public void swapEm(int n1, int n2) {
    int temp = n1;
    n1 = n2;
    n2 = temp;}

        <p>
          For the two-dimensional array you created in the previous exercise,
          write a nested for loop to print the values in the following order: 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 11 4 8 12.
          That is, print the values going down the columns instead of going across the rows.

      <li>
        <p>
          Define an array that would be suitable for storing the following values:

          A magic square
            <idx><h>square</h></idx>
          is an <m>N\; \times\; N</m> matrix of numbers in which every number from 1 to <m>N^2</m> must appear just once,

          The <em>merge sort</em> algorithm takes two collections of data that have been sorted and merges them together.
          Write a program that takes two 25-element <c>int</c> arrays,
          sorts them,
          and then merges them, in order,
          into one 50-element array.

          <term>Challenge: </term>: Design and implement a <c>BigInteger</c> class that can add and subtract integers with up to 25 digits.
          Your class should also include methods for input and output of the numbers.
          If you're really ambitious, include methods for multiplication and division.

          The accounts are numbered from <c>0, 1, <ellipsis /> ,N</c>. The problem is that you don't know in advance how many purchases each account will have.

          An <em>anagram</em> is a word made by rearranging the letters of another word.
          For example, <em>act</em> is an anagram of <em>cat</em>,
          and <em>aegllry</em> is an anagram of <em>allergy</em>.
          Write a Java program that accepts two words as input and determines if they are anagrams.

          <term>Challenge: </term>: An <em>anagram dictionary</em>
          is a dictionary that organizes words together with their anagrams.
          Write a program that lets the user enter up to 100 words
          (in a <c>TextField</c>, say).
          After each word is entered, the program should display
          (in a <c>TextArea</c> perhaps)

          Acme Trucking Company has hired you to write software to help dispatch its trucks.
          One important element of this software is knowing the distance between any two cities that it services.
          Design and implement a <c>Distance</c> class that stores the distances between cities in a two-dimensional array.
          This class will need some way to map a city name, <em>Boise</em>,
          into an integer that can be used as an array subscript.
          The class should also contain methods that would make it useful for looking up the distance between two cities.
          Another useful method would tell the user the closest city to a given city.

          Rewrite the <c>main()</c> method for the <c>WordGuess</c> example so that it allows the user to input the number of players and whether each players is a computer or a human.
          Use a <c>KeyboardReader</c>.

          Write a smarter version of the <c>WordGuesser</c> class that
          <q>knows</q>
          which letters of the English language are most frequent.
          HINT: Rather than using random guesses,
          store the player's guesses in a string in order of decreasing frequency: "ETAONRISHLGCMFBDGPUKJVWQXYZ".
