  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    This chapter introduces some of the basic concepts and techniques involved in Java program design and development.
  </p>
  <p>
    We begin by identifying the main steps in designing an object-oriented program.
    The steps are illustrated by designing a program that
    <q>asks</q>
    and
    <q>answers</q>
    riddles. For example,
  </p>
  <c>
    Riddle: What is black and white and red all over?
    Answer: An embarrassed zebra.
  </c>
  <p>
    Following the design phase,
    we then focus on the steps involved in coding a Java program,
    including the process of editing,
    compiling, and running a program.
    Because Java programs can be text based applications or window based graphical applications,
    we describe how the coding process differs for these two varieties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we begin to familiarize ourselves with Java's extensive class library by studying its <c>PrintStream</c> and <c>System</c> classes.
    These classes contain objects and methods that enable us to print output from a program.
    By the end of the chapter you will be able to design and write a Java application that
    <q>sings</q> your favorite song.
