  <title>String Basics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      To review, in Java, strings are considered full-fledged objects.
      A <c>String</c> is a sequence of the characters (data)
      plus the actions (methods) that are used to manipulate the string.
      The <c>java.lang.String</c> class (<xref ref="fig-string-UML">Figure</xref>)  
      is a direct subclass of <c>Object</c>, and it contains many public methods 
      that can be used to perform useful operations on strings
      (such as concatenation).
    </p>

      <caption>The <c>String</c> class.</caption>
      <image width="40%" source="chptr07/stringclass.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We will discuss a selection of the more commonly used methods,
      but for a full description of the <c>String</c> class see the
      <url href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">
      official Java documentation</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other object variables, <c>String</c> variables serve as <em>references</em>
      to their respective objects.
      However, unlike other Java objects, the <c>String</c> type has certain 
      characteristics in common with the primitive data types.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      as we have already seen, Java allows for literal strings.
      A <term>string literal</term> is a sequence of zero or more characters 
      contained in double quotes, such as
      <q>Socrates</q>
      and <q></q>
      (the <term>empty string</term>).
      Java allows us to perform operations on literal strings,
      such as concatenation.
      As we have already seen,
      the expression <c>"Hello" + "world"</c> results in the string 
      <c>"Helloworld"</c>. Java also allows us to use string literals to initialize <c>String</c> variables with an assignment statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given how much we use <c>String</c> objects, these exceptional features 
      represent a good design decision for Java.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="emptystring">
    <title>Constructing Strings</title>
    <p>
      To create <c>String</c> objects,
      the <c>String</c> class provides many constructors,
      including the following:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      public String();        // Creates an empty string
        // Copy constructor: Creates a copy of a string
      public String(String initial_value);
    </input></program>
    <p>
      When we create an object using the default constructor, as in
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
     String name = new String();
    </input></program>
    <p>
      Java will create a <c>String</c> object and make <c>name</c>
      the reference to it (e.g., <xref ref="fig-emptystr">Figure</xref>).
      In addition to storing the sequence of characters that make up the string, 
      Java also stores an integer value representing the number of characters in the string.
      For the default constructor, the object's value is the empty string 
      and its count is 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we have chosen to represent these two elements as the instance 
      variables, <c>value</c> and <c>count</c>, 
      we don't know exactly how Java stores the sequence of characters.
      That information is hidden.
    </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-emptystr">
        <caption></caption>
        <image width="35%" source="chptr07/p349f2.png"/> 
      </figure>
    <p>
      The second constructor in <xref ref="fig-string-UML">Figure</xref> is 
      the <term>copy constructor</term>, used to clone or duplicate an object.
      Many Java classes have copy constructors.
      Consider the following statements:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      String s1 = new String("Hello");
      String s2 = new String(s1);
    </input></program>
    <p>
      These two statements would result in two distinct <c>String</c> objects,
      both storing the word
      <q>Hello</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in the first of the preceding statements,
      we used the literal string
      <q>Hello</q>
      in the constructor.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-socrates"> 
      <image width="35%" source="chptr07/p349f3.png"/> 
      <caption>The literal <c>String</c> <q>Socrates.</q></caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      When Java encounters a
      new literal string in a program,
      it constructs an object for it.
      For example, if your program contained the literal
      <q>Socrates,</q>
      Java would create an object for it and treat the literal 
      itself as a reference to the object (<xref ref="fig-socrates">Figure</xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      We often use a string literal to assign a value to a <c>String</c> variable:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      String s;      // The value of s is initially null
      s = "Socrates";// s now refers to "Socrates" object
    </input></program>
    <p>
      In this case, the reference variable <em>s</em>
      is initially <c>null</c> <mdash/> that is,
      it has no referent, no object, to refer to.
      However, after the assignment statement,
      <em>s</em> would refer to the literal object
      <q>Socrates,</q>
      which is depicted in <xref ref="fig-socrates">Figure</xref>.
      Given these two statements, we still have only one object,
      the <c>String</c> object containing the word
      <q>Socrates</q>. But now we have two references to it: the literal string
      <q>Socrates,</q>
      and the reference variable <em>s</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assignment statements can also be used as initializers when declaring a <c>String</c> variable:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      String name1 = "";         // Reference to the empty string
      String name2 = "Socrates"; // References to "Socrates"
      String name3 = "Socrates";
    </input></program>
    <p>
      In this example, Java does not construct new <c>String</c> objects.
      Instead, as <xref ref="fig-literalrefs">Figure</xref> shows,
      it simply makes the variables <c>name1</c>, <c>name2</c>, and <c>name3</c> 
      serve as references to the same objects that are referred to by the literal strings
      <q></q> and <q>Socrates.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a direct consequence of Java's policy of creating only one object 
      to serve as the referent of a literal string,
      no matter how many occurrences there are of that literal in the program.
      Thus, these declarations result in no new objects,
      just new references to existing objects.
      By npt duplicating lierals, this policy saves lots of memory in our programs.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-literalrefs">
      <caption> The variables <c>name1</c>, <c>name2</c>, 
      and <c>name3</c> serve as references to the literals 
      <q>Socrates</q>   and ``''.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="chptr07/p350f1.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Finally, consider the following declarations,
      which do invoke the <c>String</c> constructors:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
String name4 = new String();    // Creates an object
String name5 = new String("Socrates");
String name6 = name4;
 </input></program>
    <p>
      In this case,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig-strobjects">Figure</xref>, Java creates two new 
      objects and sets <c>name4</c> to refer to the first and <c>name5</c> to refer to the second.
      It gives <c>name4</c> the empty string as its value,
      and it gives <c>name5</c> <q>Socrates</q> as its value.
      But these two objects must be distinguished from the objects 
      corresponding to the literals <q></q> and <q>Socrates</q> themselves.
      The declaration of <c>name6</c> just creates a second reference to the 
      object referred to by <c>name4</c>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-strobjects">
    <image width="50%" source="chptr07/p351f1.png"/> 
    <caption>Together with the objects in <xref ref="fig-literalrefs">Figure</xref>,
      there are now four different <c>String</c> objects with eight different references to them,
      including the literals  <q>Socrates</q>  and <q></q>.</caption>
    </figure>  
    <principle>
      <title>Strings</title>
      <p>
        Java <c>String</c> s are full-fledged objects,
        but they have some properties in common with primitive types.
        They can have literal values and they can be used in assignment statements.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>String Declaration and Instantiation</title>
      <p>
        Unless a <c>String()</c> constructor is called explicitly,
        no new <c>String</c> object is created when declaring 
        a <c>String</c> variable and assigning it an initial value.
      </p>
    </principle>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="self-study-exercisesA20">
    <title>Concatenating Strings</title>
    <p>
      Another way to build a <c>String</c> object is to concatenate two other strings.
      Recall from <xref ref="chapter-objects">Chapter</xref>
      that there are two ways to perform string concatenation in Java: We can use the <c>concat()</c> method or the concatenation operator,
      <m>+</m>.
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
String lastName = "Onassis";
String jackie =
   new String("Jacqueline " + "Kennedy " + lastName);
System.out.println("Jacqueline".concat(lastName));
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The second of these statements uses the
      <em>concatenation  operator</em>,
      <m>+</m>,
      to create the <c>String</c>
      <q>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.</q>
      The third statement uses the <c>String</c> method, <c>concat()</c>, to print
      <q>JacquelineOnassis.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the + symbol as the string concatenation operator is  another example of
      <em>operator overloading</em><mdash/>using the same operator for two or more different operations<mdash/>which we encountered in Chapter<nbsp/>5.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>String Concatenation</title>
      <p>
        When surrounded on either side by a <c>String</c>, the + symbol is used as a binary
        <term>concatenation</term> operator.
        It has the effect of joining two strings together to form a single string.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Note that primitive types are automatically promoted to <c>String</c> s when they are mixed with concatenation operators.
      Thus, the statement
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
System.out.println("The sum of 5 and 5 = "+ (5 + 5));
 </input></program>
    <p>
      will print the string
      <q>The sum of 5 and 5 = 10.</q>
      Note that the integer addition<mdash/>(5 + 5)<mdash/>is performed first,
      before the integer result is converted into a String.
      If we had left off the parentheses around the addition operation,
      the second plus sign would also be interpreted as a concatenation operator.
      Thus,
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
System.out.println("The concatenation of 5 and 5 = " + 5 + 5);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      would print
      <q>The concatenation of 5 and 5 = 55.</q>

    <title>Indexing <c>String</c> s</title>
    <p>
      Programmers often need to take strings apart or put them together or rearrange them.
      Just think of the many word-processing tasks,
      such as cut and paste, that involve such operations.
      To help simplify such operations,
      it is useful to know how many characters a string contains and to number,
      or <em>index</em>, the characters that make up the string.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of characters in a string is called its <em>length</em>.
      The <c>String</c> instance method, <c>length()</c>, returns an integer that gives the <c>String</c>'s length.
      For example,
      consider the following
<c>String</c> declarations and the corresponding values of the
<c>length()</c> method for each case:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
String string1 = "";           string1.length()  ==> 0
String string2 = "Hello";      string2.length()  ==> 5
String string3 = "World";      string3.length()  ==> 5
String string4 = string2 + " "
    + string3;                 string4.length()  ==> 11
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The position of a particular character in a string is called its
      <term>string index</term>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-0index">
      <image width="59%" source="chptr07/7f5.png"/>
      <caption>Strings are 0-indexed in Java.</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      All <c>String</c> s in Java are <term>zero indexed</term>
          <idx><h>zero indexed</h></idx>
      <mdash/> that is, the index of the first character is zero.
      (Remember, zero indexing is contrasted with <term>unit indexing</term>,
      in which we start counting at 1.)
      For example, in
      <q>Socrates,</q>
      the letter <em>S</em> occurs at index 0, the letter
      <em>o</em> occurs at index 1, <em>r</em>
      occurs at index 3, and so on.
      Thus, the <c>String</c>
      <q>Socrates</q>
      contains eight characters indexed from 0 to 7 (<xref ref="fig-0index">Figure</xref>).
      Zero indexing is customary in programming languages.
      We will see other examples of this when we talk about arrays and vectors.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>String Indexing</title>
      <p>
        Strings are indexed starting at 0.
        The first character in a string is at position 0.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Zero Versus Unit Indexing</title>
      <p>
        Syntax and semantic errors will result if you forget that strings are zero indexed.
        In a string of <em>N</em> characters,
        the first character occurs at index 0 and the last at index <m>N-1</m>.
        This is different from the <c>String.length()</c> method,
        which gives the number of characters in the string, counting from 1.

    <title>Converting Data to Strings</title>
    <p>
      The <c>String.valueOf()</c> method is a <em>class method</em>
      that is used to convert a value of some primitive type into a <c>String</c> object.
      For example,
      the expression, <c>String.valueOf(128)</c> converts 
      its <c>int</c> argument to the<nbsp/><c>String</c>
      <q>128.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different versions of <c>valueOf()</c>, each of which has the following type of signature:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
static public String valueOf(Type);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      where <c>Type</c> stands for any primitive data type,
      including <c>boolean</c>, <c>char</c>, <c>int</c>, <c>double</c>, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>valueOf()</c> method is most useful for initializing
<c>String</c> s.
      Because <c>valueOf()</c> is a class method,
      it can be used as follows to instantiate new <c>String</c> objects:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
String number = String.valueOf(128); // Creates "128"
String truth = String.valueOf(true); // Creates "true"
String bee = String.valueOf('B');    // Creates "B"
String pi = String.valueOf(Math.PI);  // Creates "3.14159"
 </input></program>
    <p>
      We have already seen that Java automatically promotes primitive type values to <c>String</c> where necessary,
      so why do we need the <c>valueOf()</c> methods?
      For example,
      we can initialize a
<c>String</c> to
      <q>3.14159</q>
      as follows:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
String pi = new String(""+Math.PI);// Creates "3.14"
 </input></program>
    <p>
      In this case, because it is part of a concatenation expression,
      the value of <c>Math.PI</c> will automatically be promoted to a <c>String</c> value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of the <c>valueOf()</c> method is twofold.
      First, it may be the method that the Java compiler relies on to perform string promotions such as this one.
      Second, using it in a program<mdash/>even when it is not completely necessary<mdash/>makes the promotion operation explicit rather than leaving it implicit.
      This  helps to make the code more readable.
      (Also, see Exercise 7.9.)
