            <li><p>Unit indexing and <em>zero indexing</em>.</p></li>

            <li>
              <p>
                When the first character in a string has index 0, this is known as <c>__________</c> .
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A sequence of characters enclosed within quotes is known as a <c>__________</c> .

          Given the <c>String</c><em>str</em> with the value
          <q>to be or not to be that is the question,</q>
          write Java expressions to extract each of the substrings shown below.
          For each substring, provide two sets of answers.
          One that uses the actual index numbers of the substrings<mdash/>for example,
          the first
          <q>to</q>
          goes from 0 to 2<mdash/>and a second more general solution 
          that will also retrieve the substring from the following string
          <q>it is easy to become what you want to become.</q>
          (<em>Hint</em>: In the second case,
          use <c>length()</c> and <c>indexOf()</c> along with <c>substring()</c> in your expressions.
          If necessary,
          you may use local variables to store intermediate results.
          The answer to (a) is provided as an example.)

      <li>
        <p>
          Write your own <c>equalsIgnoreCase()</c> method using only other <c>String</c> methods.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write your own <c>String</c> equality method without using <c>String.</c>equals() . 
          (<em>Hint</em>: Modify the <c>precedes()</c> method.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Even though Java's <c>String</c> class has a built-in <c>toLowerCase()</c> method,
          write your own implementation of this method.
          It should take a <c>String</c> parameter and return a <c>String</c> 
          with all its letters written in lowercase.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write a method that converts its <c>String</c> parameter so that 
          letters are written in blocks five characters long.
          For example,
          consider the following two versions of the same sentence:
 <pre>
Plain :   This is how we would ordinarily write a sentence.
Blocked : Thisi showw ewoul dordi naril ywrit easen tence.
 </pre>
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          Design and implement a Java Swing program that lets the user type a 
          document into a <c>TextArea</c> and then provides the following analysis of the document:
          the number of words in the document,
          the number of characters in the document,<nbsp/>and the percentage of words 
          that have more than six letters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Design and write a Java Swing program that searches for 
          single-digit numbers in a text and changes them to their corresponding words.
          For example, the string
          <q>4 score and 7 years ago</q>
          would be converted into
          <q>four score and seven years ago</q>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way backward and forward.
          For example, <em>mom, dad,
          radar, 727</em> and <em>able was i ere i saw elba</em>
          are all examples of palindromes.
          Write a Java Swing program that lets the user type in a word or phrase 
          and then determines whether the string is a palindrome.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write a maze program that uses a string to store a representation of the maze.
          Write a method that accepts a <c>String</c> parameter and 
          prints a two-dimensional representation of a maze.
          For example, the maze shown here,
          where <c>O</c> marks the entrance and exit can be generated from the following string:
 <pre>
String: XX_XXXXXXXX__XXX_XXXX_XX____XXX_XX_XX_XXX____X____XXXXXXXX_X
  O
XX XXXXXXX
X  XXX XXX
X XX    XX
X XX XX XX
X    X    O
XXXXXXXX X
 </pre>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write a method that takes a delimited string to store a name and address,
          from which you can print a mailing label.
          For example, if the string contains
          <q>Sam Penn:14 Bridge St.:Hoboken, NJ 01881,</q>
          the method should print the label shown in the margin. {1pt} Sam Penn 14 Bridge St.
          Hoboken, NJ 01881 <c>__________</c> }
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

          Design and implement a Java Swing program that plays Time Bomb with the user.
          Here's how the game works.
          The computer picks a secret word and then prints one asterisk for each 
          letter in the word: * * * * *.  The user guesses at the letters in the word.
          For every correct guess,
          an asterisk is replaced by a letter:  * e * * *.  For every incorrect guess,
          the time bomb's fuse grows shorter.
          When the fuse disappears,
          after say, six incorrect guesses, the bomb explodes.
          Store the secret words in a delimited string and invent your own representation for the time bomb.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          <term>Challenge:</term>  The global replace function is a string-processing 
          algorithm found in every word processor.
          Write a method that takes three <c>String</c> arguments:
          a document, a target string, and a replacement string.
          The method should replace every occurrence of the target string in the 
          document with the replacement string.
          For example, if the document is
          <q>To be or not to be, that is the question,</q>
          and the target string is
          <q>be,</q>, and the replacement string is
          <q>see,</q>
          the result should be,
          <q>To see or not to see, that is the question.</q>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          <term>Challenge:</term>  Design and implement a Java Swing Program that plays 
          the following game with the user.
          Let the user pick a letter between
          <em>A</em> and <em>Z</em>.
          Then let the computer guess, the secret letter.
          For every guess the player has to tell the computer whether it's too high or too low.
          The computer should be able to guess the letter within five guesses.
          Do you see why?
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
          <term>Challenge:</term> A <em>list</em> is a sequential data structure.
          Design a <c>List</c> class that uses a comma-delimited <c>String</c> <mdash/> such as,
          <q>a,b,c,d,12,dog</q> <mdash/> to implement a list.
          Implement the following methods for this class:
 <program language="java"><input>
void addItem( Object o );      // Use Object.toString()
String getItem(int position);
String toString();
void deleteItem(int position);
void deleteItem(String item);
int getPosition(String item);
String getHead();              // First element
List getTail();                // All but the first element
int length();                  // Number of items
 </input></program>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          <term>Challenge:</term> Use a delimited string to create a <c>PhoneList</c> 
          class with an instance method to insert names and phone numbers,
          and a method to look up a phone number when a user provides a person's name.
          Since your class will take care of looking things up,
          you don't have to worry about keeping the list in alphabetical order.
          For example,
          the following string could be used as such a directory:
 <pre>
mom:860-192-9876::bill g:654-0987-1234::mary lancelot:123-842-1100
 </pre>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Design and implement an application that displays a multi-line message 
          in various fonts and sizes input by the user.
          Let the user choose from among a fixed selection of fonts, sizes,
          and styles.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
