     <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term>  You are given two different length ropes that have the characteristic 
        that they both take exactly one hour to burn.
        However, neither rope burns at a constant rate.
        Some sections of the ropes burn very fast;
        other sections burn very slowly.
        All you have to work with is a box of matches and the two ropes.
        Describe an algorithm that uses the ropes and the matches to calculate when exactly 45 minutes have elapsed.

     <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term> A polar bear that lives right at the North Pole can walk due south for one hour,
        due east for one hour,
        and due north for one hour, and end up right back where it started.
        Is it possible to do this anywhere else on earth?
        Explain.

     <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term>  Lewis Carroll,
        the author of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>,
        used the following puzzle to entertain his guests: A captive queen weighing 195 pounds,
        her son weighing 90 pounds,
        and her daughter weighing 165 pounds,
        were trapped in a very high tower.
        Outside their window was a pulley and rope with a basket fastened on each end.
        They managed to escape by using the baskets and a 75-pound weight they found in the tower.
        How did they do it?
        The problem is that anytime the difference in weight between the two baskets is more than 15 pounds,
        someone might get hurt.
        Describe an algorithm that gets them down safely.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term> Here's another Carroll favorite: A farmer needs to cross a river with his fox, goose,
        and a bag of corn.
        There's a rowboat that will hold the farmer and one other passenger.
        The problem is that the fox will eat the goose if they are left alone on the river bank,
        and the goose will eat the corn if they are left alone on the river bank.
        Write an algorithm that describes how he got across without losing any of his possessions.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term> Have you heard this one?
        A farmer lent the mechanic next door a 40-pound weight.
        Unfortunately,
        the mechanic dropped the weight and it broke into four pieces. The good news is that,
        according to the mechanic,
        it is still possible to use the four pieces to weigh any quantity between one 
         40 pounds on a balance scale. How much did each of the four pieces weigh? 
        (<em>Hint</em>: You can weigh a 4-pound object on a balance by putting a 5-pound 
         weight on one side and a 1-pound weight on the other.)

        Suppose your little sister asks you to show her how to use a 
        pocket calculator so that she can calculate her homework average in her science course.
        Describe an algorithm that she can use to find the average of 10 homework grades.

        A Caesar cipher is a secret code in which each letter of the alphabet is shifted by
        <em>N</em> letters to the right,
        with the letters at the end of the alphabet wrapping around to the beginning.
        For example,
        if <em>N</em> is 1, when we shift each letter to the right,
        the word <em>daze</em> would be written as <em>ebaf</em>.
        Note that the <em>z</em> has wrapped around to the beginning of the alphabet.
        Describe an algorithm that can be used to create a Caesar encoded message with a shift of 5.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Suppose you received the message,
        <q>sxccohv duh ixq,</q>
        which you know to be a Caesar cipher.
        Figure out what it says and then describe an algorithm that will always find what the 
        message said regardless of the size of the shift that was used.

        Suppose you're talking to your little brother on the phone and he wants you to calculate his homework average.
        All you have to work with is a piece of chalk and a very small chalkboard<mdash/>big enough to write one four-digit number.
        What's more,
        although your little brother knows how to read numbers,
        he doesn't know how to count very well so he can't tell you how many grades there are.
        All he can do is read the numbers to you.
        Describe an algorithm that will calculate the correct average under these conditions.

     <p><term>Challenge:</term> Define a class that represents a <c>Temperature</c> object.
        It should store the current temperature in an instance variable of type <c>double</c>, 
        and it should have two <c>public</c> methods, <c>setTemp(double t)</c>, which assigns <c>t</c> to the instance variable,
        and <c>getTemp()</c>, which <c>return</c> s the value of the instance variable.
        Use the <c>Riddle</c> class as a model.

     <p><term>Challenge:</term> Define a class named <c>TaxWhiz</c> that computes the sales tax for a purchase.
        It should store the current tax rate as an instance variable.
        Following the model of the <c>Riddle</c> class,
        you can initialize the rate using a <c>TaxWhiz()</c> constructor.
        This class should have one <c>public</c> method, <c>calcTax(double purchase)</c>, 
        which will <c>return</c> a <c>double</c>, whose value is <c>purchases</c> times the tax rate.
        For example, if the tax rate is 4 percent, 0.04, and the purchase is $100,
        then <c>calcTax()</c> should return 4.0.
