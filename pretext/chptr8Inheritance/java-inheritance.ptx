  <title>Java's Inheritance Mechanism</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we described in Chapter<nbsp/>0,
      <term>class inheritance</term> is the mechanism whereby a class acquires (<em>inherits</em>) the methods and variables of its superclasses.
      To remind you of the basic concept,
      let's repeat an earlier example: Just as horses inherit the attributes and behaviors associated with mammals and vertebrates,
      a Java subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors of its superclasses.

      <xref ref="fig-horsehier">Figure</xref>
      uses a UML diagram to illustrate the relationships among horses,
      mammals, vertebrates, and animals.
      As the root of the hierarchy,
      which is always shown at the top,
      the Animal class contains the most general attributes,
      such as being alive and being able to move.
      All animals share these attributes.
      The class of vertebrates is a somewhat more specialized type of animal,
      in that vertebrates have backbones.
      Similarly, the class of mammals is a further specialization over the vertebrates in that mammals are warm-blooded and nurse their young.
      Finally, the class of horses is a further specialization over the class of mammals,
      in that all horses have four legs, but it inherits the features of the classes above it.
      <!-- Some mammals,
      such as humans and penguins, do not have four legs.
      Thus, by virtue of its class's position in this hierarchy,
      we can infer that a horse is a living, moving,
      four-legged vertebrate, which is warm blooded and nurses its young.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      We have deliberately used an example from the natural world to show that the concept of inheritance in Java is inspired by its counterpart in the natural world.
      But how does the concept of inheritance apply to Java (and to other object-oriented languages)?
      And, more importantly,
      how do we use the inheritance mechanism in object-oriented design?

  <subsection xml:id="student-inheritance">
    <title>Using an Inherited Method</title>
    <p>
      In Java, the public and protected instance methods and instance variables of a superclass are inherited by all of its subclasses.
      This means that objects belonging to the subclasses can use the inherited variables and methods as their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already seen some examples of this in earlier chapters.
      For example,
      recall that by default all Java classes are subclasses of the
<c>Object</c> class,
      which is the most general class in Java's class hierarchy.
      One public method that is defined in the <c>Object</c> class is the
<c>toString()</c> method.
      Because every class in the Java hierarchy is a subclass of <c>Object</c>, every class inherits the <c>toString()</c> method.
      Therefore, <c>toString()</c> can be used with any Java object.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate this,
      suppose we define a <c>Student</c> class as follows:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public class Student {
    protected String name;
    public Student(String s) {
        name = s;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
  }
 </input></program>

    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-student1">Figure</xref>
      shows the relationship between this class  and the <c>Object</c> class.
       
      <figure xml:id="fig-student1"><caption>Student inherits from Object</caption>      
      <image width="35%" source="chptr08/student1.png"/>
      </figure>

      As a subclass of <c>Object</c>, the <c>Student</c> class inherits the <c>toString()</c> method.
      Therefore, for a given <c>Student</c> object,
      we can call its <c>toString()</c> as follows:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
Student stu = new Student("Stu");
System.out.println(stu.toString());
 </input></program>
    <p>
      How does Java know where to find the <c>toString()</c> method, which,
      after all,
      is not defined in the <c>Student</c> class?
        When the expression <c>stu.toString()</c> is executed, Java will first look in the <c>Student</c> class for a definition of the <c>toString()</c> method.
      Not finding one there,
      it will then search up the
<c>Student</c> class hierarchy () until it finds a public or protected definition of the <c>toString()</c> method.
      In this case,
      it finds a <c>toString()</c> method in the <c>Object</c> class and it executes that implementation of <c>toString()</c>. As you know from Chapter<nbsp/>3,
      this would result in the expression <c>stu.toString()</c> returning something like: <c>Student@cde100</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default implementation of <c>toString()</c> returns the name of the object's class and the address
      (<c>cde100</c>) where the object is stored in memory.
      However, this type of result is much too general and not particularly useful. See it running below.
    </p>

                name = s;
            }
            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }
            
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Student stu = new Student("Stu");
                System.out.println(stu.toString());
            }
        }

  <subsection xml:id="overriding">
    <title>Overriding an Inherited Method</title>
    <p>
      In Chapter<nbsp/>3 we pointed out that the <c>toString()</c> method is designed to be
      <em>overridden</em><mdash/>that is,
      to be redefined in subclasses of <c>Object</c>. Overriding <c>toString()</c> in a subclass provides a customized string representation of the objects in that subclass.
      We showed that by redefining <c>toString()</c> in our <c>OneRowNim</c> class,
      we customized its actions so that it returned useful information about the current state of a <c>OneRowNim</c> game.
    </p>
    <p>
      To override <c>toString()</c> for the <c>Student</c> class,
      let's add the following method definition to the <c>Student</c> class:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public String toString() {
  return "My name is " + name +  " and I am a Student.";
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-student2"><caption>Student overriding the toString() method</caption>
      <image width="35%" source="chptr08/student2.png"/>
    </figure>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Given this change,
      the revised <c>Student</c> class hierarchy is shown in <xref ref="fig-student2">Figure</xref>.
      Note that both <c>Object</c> and <c>Student</c> contain implementations of <c>toString()</c>. Now when the expression <c>stu.toString()</c> is invoked,
      the following, more informative, output is generated: <c>My name is Stu and I am a Student.</c>.
 </p>
    <p>
      In this case,
      when Java encounters the method call <c>stu.toString()</c>, it invokes the <c>toString()</c> method that 
      it finds in the <c>Student</c> class. Run this code below.
    </p>

      These examples illustrate two important object-oriented concepts:
      inheritance and method overriding.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Inheritance</title>
      <p>
        The public and protected instance methods
        (and variables)
        in a class can be used by objects that belong to the class's subclasses.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Overriding a Method</title>
      <p>
        Overriding an inherited method is an effective way to customize that method for a particular subclass.
      </p>
    </principle>

  <subsection>
    <title>Static Binding, Dynamic Binding
    and Polymorphism</title>
    <p>
      The mechanism that Java uses in these examples is known as
      <term>dynamic binding</term>,
      in which the association between a method call and the correct method implementation is made at run time.
      In dynamic binding a method call is bound to the correct implementation of the method at run time 
      by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamic binding is contrasted with
      <term>static binding</term>,
      the mechanism by which the Java compiler <em>resolves</em>
      the association between a method call and the correct method implementation when the program is compiled.
     
      In dynamic binding, when the JVM encounters a method call,
      it uses information about the class hierarchy to <em>bind</em>
      the method call to the correct implementation of that method.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Java, all method calls use dynamic binding except methods that are  declared <c>final</c> or <c>private</c>. 
      Final methods cannot be overridden,
      so declaring a method as <c>final</c> means that the Java compiler can bind it to the correct implementation.
      Similarly, private methods are not inherited and therefore cannot be overridden in a subclass.
      In effect, private methods are final methods and the compiler can perform the binding at compile time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java's dynamic-binding mechanism,
      which is also called <em>late</em>
       binding or
      <em>run-time</em> binding,
      leads to what is know as <em>polymorphism</em>.
      <term>Polymorphism</term> is a feature of object-oriented languages whereby the same method call can lead to different behaviors depending on the type of object on which the method call is made.
      The term <em>polymorphism</em> means,
      literally, having many (poly) shapes
      (morphs).
      Here's a simple example:
    </p>
    
 <program language="java"><input>
 Object obj;                        // Static type: Object
 obj = new Student("Stu");          // Actual type: Student
 System.out.println(obj.toString());// Prints "My name is Stu..."
 obj = new OneRowNim(11);           // Actual type: OneRowNim
 System.out.println(obj.toString());// Prints "nSticks = 11, player = 1"
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The variable <c>obj</c> is declared to be of type <c>Object</c>. This is its <term>static</term>
      or <em>declared</em> type.
      A variable's static type never changes.
      However, a variable also has an <term>actual</term>
      or <em>dynamic</em> type.
      This is the actual type of the object that has been assigned to the variable.
      As you know,
      an <c>Object</c> variable can be assigned objects from any <c>Object</c> subclass.
      In the second statement, <c>obj</c> is assigned a <c>Student</c> object.
      Thus, at this point in the program,
      the actual type of the variable <c>obj</c> is <c>Student</c>. When <c>obj.toString()</c> is invoked in the third line, Java begins its search for the <c>toString()</c> method at the <c>Student</c> class,
      because that is the variable's actual type.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fourth line,
      we assign a <c>OneRowNim</c> object to <c>obj</c>, thereby changing its actual type to <c>OneRowNim</c>. Thus,
      when <c>obj.toString()</c> is invoked in the last line,
      the <c>toString()</c> method is bound to the implementation found in the <c>OneRowNim</c> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, we see that the same expression, <c>obj.toString()</c>, is bound alternatively to two different <c>toString()</c> implementations,
      based on the actual type of the object, <c>obj</c>, on which it is invoked.
      This is polymorphism and we will sometimes say that the <c>
toString()</c> method is a
      <em>polymorphic</em> method.
      A <term>polymorphic method</term>
      is a method signature that behaves differently when it is invoked on different objects.
      An overridden method,
      such as the <c>toString()</c> method,
      is an example of a polymorphic method,
      because its use can lead to different behaviors depending upon the object on which it is invoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- The previous example is admittedly somewhat contrived.
      In some object-oriented languages,
      a code segment such as that above would use static binding rather than dynamic binding.
      In other words,
      the compiler would be able to figure out the bindings. -->
      Let's take an example where static binding,
      also called <em>early</em> binding, is not possible.
      Consider the following method definition:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public void polyMethod(Object obj) {
  System.out.println(obj.toString()); // Polymorphic
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The method call in this method, <c>obj.toString()</c>, can't be bound to the correct implementation of 
      <c>toString()</c> until the method is actually invoked<mdash/>that is,
      at run time.
      For example,
      suppose we make the following method calls in a program:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
 Student stu = new Student("Stu");
 polyMethod(stu);
 OneRowNim nim = new OneRowNim();
 polyMethod(nim);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The first time <c>polyMethod()</c> is called,
      the <c>obj.toString()</c> is invoked on a <c>Student</c> object.
      Java will use its dynamic binding mechanism to associate this method call with the
<c>toString()</c> implementation in <c>Student</c> and output
      <q>My name is Stu and I am a Student.</q>
      The second time <c>polyMethod()</c> is called,
      the <c>obj.toString()</c> expression is invoked on a <c>OneRowNim</c> object.
      In this case, Java will bind the method call to the implementation in the <c>OneRowNim</c> class.
      The output generated in this case will report how many sticks are left in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important point here is that polymorphism occurs when an overridden method is called on a superclass variable, <c>obj</c>. In such a case,
      the actual method implementation that is invoked is determined at run time.
      The determination depends on the type of object that was assigned to the variable.
      Thus, we say that the method call <c>obj.toString()</c> is polymorphic because it is bound to different implementations of <c>toString()</c> depending on the actual type of the object that is bound to <c>obj</c>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="polym">
    <title>Polymorphism and Object-Oriented Design</title>
    <p>
      Now that we understand how inheritance and polymorphism work in Java,
      it will be useful to consider an example that illustrates how these mechanisms can be useful in designing classes and methods.
      We have been using the various <c>System.out.print()</c> and <c>System.out.println()</c> methods since Chapter<nbsp/>1.
      The <c>print()</c> and
<c>println()</c> methods are examples of
      <term>overloaded</term> methods<mdash/>that is,
      methods that have the same name but different  parameter lists.
      Remember that a method's signature involves its name,
      plus the type, number, and order of its parameters.
      Methods that have the same name but different parameters are said to be overloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the signatures of some of the different <c>print()</c> and
<c>println()</c> methods:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
print(char c);           println(char c);
print(int i);            println(int i);
print(double d);         println(double d);
print(float f);          println(float f);
print(String s);         println(String s);
print(Object o);         println(Object o);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Basically, there is a <c>print()</c> and <c>println()</c> method for every type of primitive data,
      plus methods for printing any type of object.
      When Java encounters an expression involving <c>print()</c> or <c>println()</c> it chooses which particular <c>print()</c> or <c>println()</c> method to call.
      To determine the correct method, Java relies on the differences in the signatures of the various <c>print()</c> methods.
      For example,
      because its argument is an <c>int</c>, the expression <c>print(5)</c> is associated with the method whose signature is <c>print(int i)</c> be cause its parameter is an <c>int</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there is only one set of <c>print()</c> and <c>println()</c> methods for printing <c>Object</c> s.
      The reason is that polymorphism is used by the <c>print(Object o)</c> and <c>println(Object o)</c> methods to print any type of object.
      While we do not have access to the source code for these methods,
      we can make an educated guess that their implementations utilize the polymorphic <c>toString()</c> method,
      as follows:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public void print(Object o) {
     System.out.print(o.toString());
 }
 public void println(Object o) {
     System.out.println(o.toString());
 }
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Here again we have a case where an expression, <c>o.toString()</c>, is bound dynamically to the correct implementation of
<c>toString()</c> based on the type of <c>Object</c> that the variable
<c>o</c> is bound to.
      If we call <c>System.out.print(stu)</c>, where
<c>stu</c> is a <c>Student</c>, then the <c>Student.toString()</c> method is invoked.
      On the other hand,
      if we call <c>System.out.print(game)</c>, where <c>game</c> is a <c>OneRowNim</c>, then the <c>OneRowNim.toString()</c> method is invoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of using polymorphism in this way is the flexibility and  extensibility that it allows.
      The <c>print()</c> and <c>println()</c> methods can print any type of object,
      even new types of objects that did not exist when these library methods were written.

    <title>Using <c>super</c> to Refer to the Superclass</title>
    <p>
      One question that might occur to you is: Once you override the default
<c>toString()</c> method,
      is it then impossible to invoke the default method on a <c>Student</c> object?
      The default <c>toString()</c> method
      (and any method from an object's superclass)
      can be invoked using the
<c>super</c> keyword.
      For example,
      suppose that within the <c>Student</c> class,
      you wanted to concatenate the result of both the default and the new <c>toString()</c> methods.
      The following expression would accomplish that:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
super.toString() + toString()
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The <c>super</c> keyword specifies that the first
<c>toString()</c> is the one implemented in the superclass.
      The second

    <title>Inheritance and Constructors</title>
    <p>
      Java's inheritance mechanism applies to a class's public and protected instance variables and methods.
      It does not apply to a class's constructors.
      To illustrate some of the implications of this language feature,
      let's define a subclass of <c>Student</c> called <c>CollegeStudent</c>:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public class CollegeStudent extends Student {
    public CollegeStudent() { }
    public CollegeStudent(String s) {
        super(s);
    }
    public String toString() {
       return "My name is " + name +
               " and I am a CollegeStudent.";
    }
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Because <c>CollegeStudent</c> is a subclass of <c>Student</c>, 
      it inherits the public and 
    protected instance methods and variables from <c>Student</c>. 
    So, a <c>CollegeStudent</c> has an instance variable for <c>name</c> and it 
    has a public <c>getName()</c> method.
  </p>
 <figure  xml:id="fig-collstudent">
 <caption>College Student inherits from Student.</caption>
  <image width="35%" source="chptr08/collstudent.png"/>
  </figure>
  <p></p>
  <p>
      Recall that a <c>protected</c> element,
      such as the <c>name</c> variable in the <c>Student</c> class,
      is accessible only within the class and its subclasses.
      Unlike <c>public</c> elements,
      it is not accessible to other classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <c>CollegeStudent</c> overrides the <c>toString()</c> method,
      giving it a more customized implementation.
      The hierarchical relationship between <c>CollegeStudent</c> and <c>Student</c> is shown in 
      <xref ref="fig-collstudent">Figure</xref>.
      A <c>CollegeStudent</c> is a <c>Student</c> and both are <c>Object</c>s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note how we have implemented the <c>CollegeStudent(String s)</c> constructor.
      Because the superclass's constructors are not inherited,
      we have to implement this constructor in the subclass if we want to be able to assign a <c>CollegeStudent</c>'s name during object construction.
      The method call, <c>super(s)</c>, is used to invoke the superclass constructor and pass it
      <em>s</em>, the student's name.
      The superclass constructor will then assign <em>s</em>
      to the <c>name</c> variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have noted,
      a subclass does not inherit constructors from its  superclasses.
      However, if the subclass constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, Java will automatically invoke the default superclass constructor<mdash/>in this case, <c>super()</c>. By
      <term>default superclass constructor</term>
      we mean the constructor that has no parameters.
      For a subclass that is several layers down in the hierarchy,
      this automatic invoking of the <c>super()</c> constructor will be repeated upwards through the entire class hierarchy.
      Thus when a <c>CollegeStudent</c> is constructed, Java will automatically call <c>Student()</c> and <c>Object()</c>. Note that if one of the superclasses does not contain a default constructor,
      this will result in a syntax error.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you think about this, it makes good sense.
      How else will the inherited elements of the object be created?
      For example,
      in order for a <c>CollegeStudent</c> to have a <c>name</c> variable,
      a <c>Student</c> object,
      where name is declared, must be created.
      The <c>CollegeStudent</c> constructor then extends the definition of the <c>Student</c> class.
      Similarly, in order for a <c>Student</c> object to have the attributes common to all objects,
      an <c>Object</c> instance must be created and then extended into a <c>Student</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, unless a constructor explicitly calls a superclass constructor, Java will automatically invoke the default superclass constructors.
      It does this <em>before</em> executing the code in its own constructor.
    </p>
      <!--
      For example,
      if you had two classes, <c>A</c> and <c>B</c>, where <c>B</c> is a subclass of <c>A</c>, 
      then whenever you create an instance of
      <c>B</c>, Java will first invoke <c>A</c>'s constructor before executing the 
      code in <c>B</c>'s constructor.
      Thus, Java's default behavior during construction of <c>B</c> is equivalent 
      to the following implementation of <c>B</c>'s constructor:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public B() {
    A();   // Call the superconstructor
    // Now continue with this constructor's code}
 </input></program>
-->
    <p>
      Calls to the default constructors are made all the way up the class hierarchy,
      and the superclass constructor is always called before the code 
      in the class's constructor is executed.
