<li>
    <p>
        Arrange the following data types into a <em>promotion</em>
        hierarchy: <c> double</c>, <c> float</c>, <c> int</c>, <c> short</c>, <c> long</c>.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        Assuming that <c>o1</c> is true, <c>o2</c> is false,
        and <c>o3</c> is false, evaluate each of the following expressions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>  <c>o1 || o2 &amp;&amp; o3</c></li>
        <li>  <c>o1 ^ o2</c></li>
        <li>  <c>!o1 &amp;&amp; !o2</c></li>
    </ol>

        <c>+ - () * / % &lt; ==</c>
    </p>
</li>
<li> 
    <p> 
        Arrange the following operators into a precedence hierarchy:
        <c>*,++, %, ==</c>
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Parenthesize and evaluate each of the following expressions. (If an expression 
        is invalid, mark it as such):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>  <c>11 / 3 % 2 == 1</c></li>
        <li>  <c>11 / 2 % 2 > 0</c></li>
        <li>  <c>15 % 3 >= 21 %</c></li>
        <li>  <c>12.0 / 4.0 >= 12 / 3</c></li>
        <li>  <c>15 / 3 == true</c></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        What value would <c>m</c> have after each of the 
        statements that follow is executed?  Assume that <c>m, k, j</c> are
        reinitialized before each statement.
        <program language="java"><input>
            int m = 5, k = 0, j = 1;
        </input></program>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>  <c>m = ++k + j;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>m += ++k * j;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>m %= ++k + ++j;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>m = m - k - j;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>m = ++m;</c></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        What value would <c>b</c> have after each of the 
        statements that follow is executed? Assume that <c>m, k, j</c> are reinitialized
        before each statement. It may help to parenthesize the right-hand side
        of the statements before evaluating them.
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
        boolean b;
        int m = 5, k = 0, j = 1;
   </input></program>
   <ol>
    <li>  <c>b = m > k + j;</c></li>
    <li>  b = m * m != m * j;</li>
    <li>  <c>b = m &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; m % 2 == 1;</c></li>
    <li>  <c>b = m &lt; k  || k &lt; j;</c></li>
    <li>  <c>b = --m == 2 * ++j;</c></li>
   </ol>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        For each of the following expressions, if it is valid,
        determine the value of the variable on the left-hand side
        (if not, change it to a valid expression):
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
        char c = 'a' ;
         int  m = 95;
    </input></program>
    <ol>
        <li>  <c>c = c + 5;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>c = 'A' + 'B';</c></li>
        <li>  <c>m = c + 5;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>c = (char) m + 1;</c></li>
        <li>  <c>m = 'a' - 32;</c></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Translate each of the following expressions into Java:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>  Area equals <c>pi</c> times the radius squared.</li>
        <li>  Area is assigned <c>pi</c> times the radius squared.</li>
        <li>  Volume is assigned <c>pi</c> times radius cubed divide by <c>h.</c></li>
        <li>  If <c>m</c> and <c>n</c> are equal, then <c>m</c> is incremented by one; 
            otherwise <c>n</c> is incremented.</li>
        <li>  If <c>m</c> is greater than <c>n</c>
            times 5, then square <c>m</c> and double <c>n</c>;
            otherwise square <c>n</c> and double <c>m.</c></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        What would be output by the following code segment?
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
        int m = 0, n = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
        m = 2 * n++;
        System.out.println("m= " + m + " n= " + n);
        j += ( --k * 2 );
        System.out.println("j= " + j + " k= " + k);
    </input></program>
</li>
<p>
    Each of the  problems that follow asks you to write a method.
    Of course, as you are developing the method in a stepwise
    fashion, you should test it. Here's a simple application
    program that you can use for this purpose:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
public class MethodTester {
    public static int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("5 squared = " + square(5));
    }
}
</input></program>
    <p>
        Just replace
        the <c> square()</c> method with your method. Note that
        you must declare your method <c> static</c> if you want
        to call it directly from <c> main()</c> as we do here.
    </p>
<li>  
    <p>
        Write a method to calculate the sales tax for
        a sale item. The method should take two <c> double</c> parameters, one
        for the sales price and the other for the tax rate. It should return a
        <c> double</c>.  For example, <c> calcTax(20.0, 0.05)</c> should return
        1.0.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        <term>Challenge:</term> Suppose you're writing a program that tells what
        day of the week someone's birthday falls on this year. Write a method
        that takes an <c> int</c> parameter, representing what day of the year
        it is, and returns a <c> String</c> like ``Monday.'' For example, for
        2004, a leap year, the first day of the year was on Thursday. The
        thirty-second day of the year (February 1, 2004) was a Sunday, so 
        <c>getDayOfWeek(1)</c> should return <q>Thursday</q> and <c> getDayOfWeek(32)</c>
        should return <q>Sunday.</q> (<c>Hint</c>: If you divide the day of the
        year by 7, the remainder will always be a number between 0 and 6,
        which can be made to correspond to days of the week.)
    </p>
</li>
<li> 
    <p>
        <term>Challenge:</term> As part of the birthday program, you'll want a method that
        takes the month and the day as parameters and returns what day of the
        year it is. For example, <c> getDay(1,1)</c> should return 1;
        <c> getDay(2,1)</c> should return 32; and <c> getDay(12,31)</c> should return
        365. (<c>Hint</c>: If the month is 3, and the day is 5, you have to add the
        number of days in January plus the number of days in February to 5 to
        get the result: 31 + 28 + 5 = 64.)
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Write a Java method that converts a <c> char</c>
        to lowercase. For example, <c> toLowerCase('A')</c>
        should return `a'. Make sure you guard against
        method calls like <c> toLowerCase('a')</c>.
    </p>
</li>
<li> 
    <p>
        <term>Challenge:</term> Write a Java method that shifts a
        <c> char</c> by <c>n</c> places in the alphabet, wrapping around to the
        start of the alphabet, if necessary. For example, <c> shift('a',2)</c>
        should return `c'; <c> shift('y',2)</c> should return `a'. This method
        can be used to create a Caesar cipher, in which every letter in a
        message is shifted by <c>n</c> places---hfu ju? (Refer to Chapter~1
        exercises for a refresher on Caesar cipher.)
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Write a method that converts its <c> boolean</c> parameter
        to a <c> String</c>. For example, <c> boolToString(true)</c>
        should return ``true.''
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Write a Java application that first prompts the user for    
        three numbers, which represent the sides of a rectangular cube, and
        then computes and outputs the volume and the surface area of the cube.
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Write a Java application that prompts the user for three
        numbers and then outputs the three numbers in increasing order.
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p> 
        Write a Java application that inputs two integers and
        then determines whether the first is divisible by the second.
        (<c>Hint</c>: Use the modulus operator.)
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Write a Java application that prints the following table:
    </p>
        <pre>
        N   SQUARE   CUBE
        1   1        1
        2   4        8
        3   9        27
        4   16       64
        5   25       125
        </pre>
</li>

        Design and write a Java GUI that converts kilometers to miles
        and vice versa. Use a <c> JTextField</c> for I/O and <c> JButton</c>s for
        the various conversion actions.
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Design and write a GUI that allows a user to calculate
        the maturity value of a CD. The user should enter the principal,
        interest rate, and years, and the applet should then display the
        maturity value. Make use of the <c> BankCD</c> class covered in this
        chapter.  Use separate <c> JTextField</c>s for the user's inputs and a
        separate <c> JTextField</c> for the result.
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Design and write a GUI that lets the user
        input a birth date (month and day) and reports what day of the week
        it falls on. Use the <c> getDayOfWeek()</c> and <c> getDay()</c> methods
        that you developed in previous exercises.
    </p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
        Design and write a GUI that allows the users
        to input their exam grades for a course and computes
        their average and probable letter grade. The applet should
        contain a single <c> JTextField</c> for inputting a grade
        and a single <c> JTextField</c> for displaying the average
        and letter grade. The program should keep track internally
        of how many grades the student has entered. Each time a
        new grade is entered, it should display the current average
        and probable letter grade.
    </p>

        One of the reviewers of this text has
        suggested an alternative design for the <c> Temperature</c> class
        (<xref ref="fig-temperature">Figure</xref>). According to this design, the class
        would contain an instance variable, say, <c> temperature</c>, and access
        methods that operate on it. The access methods would be: 
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
        setFahrenheit(double)
        getFahrenheit():double
        setCelsius(double)
        getCelsius():double
    </input></program>
    <p>
        One way to
        implement this design is to store the temperature in the Kelvin scale
        and then convert from and to Kelvin in the access methods.  The
        formula for converting Kelvin to Celsius is
    </p>
        <program language="java"><input>
            K = C + 273.15
        </input></program>
    <p>
        Draw a UML class diagram representing this design
        of the <c> Temperature</c> class. Which design is more object oriented,
        this one or the one used in <xref ref="fig-temperature">Figure</xref>?
    </p>
</li>
<li> 
    <p>
        Write an implementation of the <c> Temperature</c>
        class using the design described in the previous exercise. 
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
