    This chapter introduces some more of the basic principles of object-oriented programming.
        <idx><h>object-oriented metaphor</h></idx>
    We begin by looking at some examples of creating and using objects of type <c>String</c> and <c>Graphics</c>. Then,
    we examine how user defined classes are used by doing a detailed walk-through of the <c>Riddle</c> class we saw in Chapter<nbsp/>1.
    We focus on the basic Java language elements involved.
    By the end of these sections,
    you should know how to identify the key elements that make up a Java program.

    We then present a detailed example of the programming development process by designing a class that models a certain two person game and implements the class.
    The design is represented using UML notation.
