  <title>Coding Conventions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This appendix covers various aspects of programming style and coding conventions.
      It follows the conventions suggested in the 
      <url href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/" visual="">Java Language Specification</url>.
      The conventions have been modified somewhat to fit the needs of an academic programming course.
      For further details see specifically the 
      <url href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf" visual="">official code 
      conventions</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding conventions improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
      Because maintenance is often done by programmers who did not have a hand in designing or 
      writing the original code,
      it is important that the code follow certain conventions.
      For a typical piece of commercial software,
      much more time and expense are invested in maintaining the code than in creating the code.
