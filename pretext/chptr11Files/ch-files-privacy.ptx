  <title>Special Topic: Databases and Personal Privacy</title>
  <p>
    During a typical day we all come in contact with lots of electronic databases that store information about us.
    If you use a supermarket discount card,
    every purchase you make is logged against your name in the supermarket's database.
    When you use your bank card at the ATM machine,
    your financial transaction is logged against your account.
    When you charge gasoline or buy dinner,
    those transactions are logged against your credit card account.
    If you visit the doctor or dentist,
    a detailed record of your visit is transmitted to your medical insurance company's database.
    If you receive a college loan,
    detailed financial information about you is entered into several different credit service bureaus.
    And so on.

    Should we be worried about how this information is used?
    Many privacy advocates say yes.
    With the computerization of medical records, phone records,
    financial transactions, driving records, and many other records,
    there is an enormous amount of personal information held in databases.
    At the same time,
    there are pressures from a number of sources for access to this information.
    Law-enforcement agencies want to use this information to monitor individuals.
    Corporations want to use it to help them market their products.
    Political organizations want to use it to help them market their candidates.

    Recently there has been pressure from government and industry in the United States to use the social security number (SSN) as a unique identifier.
    Such an identifier would make it easy to match personal information across different databases.
    Right now, the only thing your bank records, medical records,
    and supermarket records may have in common is your name,
    which is not a unique identifier.
    If all online databases were based on your SSN, it would be much simpler to create a complete profile.
    While this might improve services and reduce fraud and crime,
    it might also pose a significant threat to our privacy.

    The development of online databases serve many useful purposes.
    They help fight crime and reduce the cost of doing business.
    They help improve government and commercial services on which we have come to depend.
    On the other hand, databases can be and have been misused.
    They can be used by unauthorized individuals or agencies or in unauthorized ways.
    When they contain inaccurate information,
    they can cause personal inconvenience or even harm.

    There are a number of organizations that have sprung up to address the privacy issues raised by online databases.
