    <p>
      The Java class library contains a number of predefined exceptions,
      some of which are shown in <xref ref="fig-excepthier">Figure</xref>.
      The most general type of exception, <c>java.lang.Exception</c>, is located in the <c>java.lang</c> package,
      but most of its subclasses are contained in other packages.
      Some of the various <c>IOException</c> classes are contained in the <c>java.io</c> package,
      while others are contained in the <c>java.net</c> package.
      In general, exception classes are placed in the package that contains the methods that throw those exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the classes in <xref ref="fig-excepthier">Figure</xref>
      identifies a particular type of exception,
      and each is a subclass of the <c>Exception</c> class.
      Obviously a subclass defines a more specific exception than its superclass.
      Thus, both <c>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</c> and <c>StringIndexOutOfBoundsException</c> are more specific than <c>IndexOutOfBoundsException</c>.

    <title>Checked and Unchecked Exceptions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Java's exception hierarchy is divided into two types of exceptions.
        A <term>checked exception</term>
            <idx><h>checked exception</h></idx>
        is one that can be analyzed by the Java  compiler.
        Checked exceptions are thrown by methods such as the <c>BufferedReader.readLine()</c> method,
        in which there is a substantial likelihood that something might go wrong.
        When the compiler encounters one of these method calls,
        it checks whether the program either handles or declares the exception.
        Compile-time checking for these exceptions is designed to reduce the number of exceptions that are not properly handled within a program.
        This improves the security of Java programs.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>Checked Exceptions</title>
        <p>
          A checked exception,
          such as an <c>IOException</c>, must either be handled or declared within the program.
        </p>
      </principle>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>The <c>throws</c>Clause</title>
      <p>
        The <c>IOException</c>, which we encountered in Chapter<nbsp/>4 , is a checked exception.
        The Java compiler knows that
<c>readLine()</c> is a method that can throw an <c>IOException</c>. A method that contains an expression that might throw a checked exception must either handle the exception or declare it.
        Otherwise, the compiler would generate a syntax error.
        The simplest way to avoid such a syntax error is to
        <em>declare the exception</em>,  in our case that means qualifying the method header with the expression
<c>throws IOException</c>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, any method that contains an expression that might throw a checked expression must declare the exception.
        However, because one method can call another method,
        declaring exceptions can get a little tricky.
        If a method calls another method that contains an expression that might throw an unchecked exception,
        then both methods must have a <c>throws</c> clause.
        For example, consider the following program:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
import java.io.*;
public class Example {
    BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader
            (new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    public void doRead() throws IOException {
        // May throw IOException
        String inputString = input.readLine();
    }
    public static void main(String argv[])
                        throws IOException {
        Example ex = new Example();
        ex.doRead();
    }}
 </input></program>
      <p>
        In this case,
        the <c>doRead()</c> method contains a
<c>readLine()</c> expression,
        which might throw an <c>IOException</c>. Therefore,
        the <c>doRead()</c> method must declare that it <c>throws
IOException</c>. However,
        because <c>doRead()</c> is called by <c>main()</c>, the <c>main()</c> method must also declare the <c>IOException</c>.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>Where to Use <c>throws</c></title>
        <p>
          Unless a checked exception,
          such as an <c>IOException</c>, is caught and handled by a method,
          it must be declared with a <c>throws</c> clause within the method and within any method that calls that method.
        </p>
      </principle>
      <p>
        The alternative approach would be to <em>catch</em>
        the <c>IOException</c> within the body of the method.
        We will discuss this approach in the next section.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Unchecked Exceptions</title>
      <p>
        An <term>unchecked exception</term>
            <idx><h>unchecked exception</h></idx>
        is any exception belonging to a subclass of <c>RuntimeException</c>(Fig.
        <xref ref="fig-excepthier"></xref>).
        Unchecked exceptions are not checked by the compiler.
        The possibility that some statement or expression will lead to an <c>ArithmeticException</c> or
<c>NullPointerException</c> is extremely difficult to detect at compile time.
        The designers of Java decided that forcing programmers to declare such exceptions would not significantly improve the correctness of Java programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, unchecked exceptions do not have to be handled within a program.
        And they do not have to be declared in a <c>throws</c> clause.
        As shown in the chapter's early divide-by-zero exception example,
        unchecked exceptions are handled by Java's default exception handlers,
        unless your program takes specific steps to handle them directly.
        In many cases leaving the handling of such exceptions up to Java may be the best course of action,
        as we will see <xref ref="sec-robust">Section</xref>.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>Unchecked Exceptions</title>
        <p>
          An unchecked exception<mdash/>one belonging to some subclass of
<c>RunTimeException</c><mdash/>does not have to be caught within your program.
        </p>
      </principle>

    <title>The <c>Exception</c>Class</title>
    <p>
      The <c>java.lang.Exception</c> class itself is very simple,
      consisting of just two constructor methods (Fig.<nbsp/>10.5).
      The <c>Throwable</c> class,
      from which <c>Exception</c> is derived,
      is the root class of Java's exception and error hierarchy.
      It contains definitions for the <c>getMessage()</c> and <c>printStackTrace()</c> methods,
      which are two methods that we will use frequently in our error-handling routines.
